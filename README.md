1. This tool can analysis the Test case priority.
2. Base on Machine Learning of the Decision Tree Algorithm, it's a Supervised learning.
3. It should training the AI model which test case is the high priority first, then base on the training model to predict the Test Case test priority. 
4. User can according to the priority result to create the test plan.
