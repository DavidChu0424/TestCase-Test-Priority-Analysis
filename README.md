1. This tool can analysis the Test case priority.
2. Base on Machine Learning of the Decision Tree Algorithm, it's a Supervised learning.
3. It should training the AI model which test case is the high priority first, then base on the training model to predict the Test Case test priority. 
4. Step : 
      - Fill in the Test experience to excel.
      - Used "Testcase Training.py" to training the AI model.
      - Used "TestCase Test.py" to export the predict result. 
      - User can refer the predict result to create the Test Plan.
